    "description":"Var enjoyWritingAboutSelf = false; An inquisitive mind paired with an old soul. Understanding the 'how' and 'why' of questions and sharing that knowledge with others brings me great joy. Tactical and strategic, reflecting on past experience and incorporating new knowledge to successfully navigate the way. Pragmatic, but quietly optimistic, if not idealistic. Resourceful and persistent, sees tasks through to completion.",

  "brandon":{
    "name":"Brandon Negen",
    "description":"Hi! I'm Brandon! I'm a fun loving guy who also appreciates what it feels like after a good, hard day of work. I thrive in environments that value working closely with teammates. I find that working with a small group of people really gives me a sense of trust. Having a sense of trust gives everything I do a little more meaning. When in an atmosphere I can thrive in it also makes being able to relax and have fun far more easier for me. I love playing golf (I'd go everyday if I could!). I'm a huge gamer and I love constantly tweeking my home built PC to get the best possible performance from it. Having pets is always something that's been important to me as well. I have a dog and a cat and their personalities never fail to make me smile. Even though I've neglected it for a long time I'm starting to fill my life with things that lift me up, inspire me, and keep me happy.",
    "shoutout":"This is going to sound silly, but I am super appreciative of Brandon killing a spider for me before class started. I have a completely illogical, but very real and occasionally crippling, fear of spiders. When I saw one on the wall, I just calmly asked a group if someone was willing to kill it, and Brandon got up and did so without making me feel like an idiot for having to ask someone to do it. It was probably a small thing for him, but meant a great deal to me!"

  "cat":{
    "name":"Cat White",
    "description":"A visionary thinker and avid dreamer - I probably think about zombie apocalypses too often. I have a never-ending urge to learn and an insatiable appetite for the unknown. As a mother of three toddlers I can multi-task like no other and stay fairly clean…well, acceptably sanitary. I’m an intuitive people-person, I get my energy from those that surround me. I enjoy being a part of a team: listening to others, contributing in a group environment, and keeping the energy positive and up. I love having my voice and thoughts heard, but more so being an ear for others. More than anything, I am a determined and committed person. Invariably driven to succeed. I may take time, but I get $h*t done!",

    "description":"I am self-confident, joyfully curious, and intensely focused on projects which engage my desire for life-long learning. I enjoy working with other people and believe that successful teams are made up of people who value one another’s differences. Lest one think I may be rather a pill after that opening statement, I also enjoy games, yelling goat videos, and your mom.",
    "shoutout":"Cena mentioned how when we were going our project how I had an answer that would have been wrong had I not said anything. It made me feel super good getting that recognition. "

Human diversity and all the ways people live and present themselves in the world is fascinating to me. I’ve had an adventurous and patchwork-y kind of life, and have so much gratitude for the diversity of experiences and people this has brought to me. It’s made me a really creative thinker, and I often surprise people with my ideas and perspectives. I love showing people that there are spaces between the creative realm and the analytical realm.",

I often deep dive into the logic of the foundational information in order to provide understanding across multiple groups about the outcomes of a given project. My experiences have provided me a lot of skills and efficiencies with troubleshooting issues that may provide roadblocks that could prevent a project from moving forward.",

I'm not afraid to talk about myself, but I usually cushion those statements with bits of humor. I try and rise to the occasion and enjoy a moderate amount of stress. I love being around people but I appreciate my time alone. I've learned to not sweat the small stuff, and that by applying myself and perservering everything will always work out.",

I guess I would describe myself an optimist. I’m a curious person, always engaged by meeting people, solving problems, and experiencing different cultures. My thirst for knowledge often leads to an extremely excessive amount of Chrome tabs open. The concept of describing myself does not come naturally though. I would much rather have my actions define me than try to sum up an infinite amount of small individual experiences in a single paragraph.",

Throughout my life I’ve had a passion for learning new things, and through this program I’ve found a field that provides endless amounts of areas to continue learning. I’m also an athlete that has, and still is, competing at the sports highest level. I’ve learned from this the rewards of setting goals, putting your head down and seeing what can be accomplished. At the same time I’ve learned what its like to fail, and how to learn from it and move forward. I love meeting new people, taking on new challenges and think I could be a great asset at this position and the company as a whole.",

    "description":"I am extremely upbeat and positive about my surroundings. I have a tendency to lighten the mood with jokes in otherwise tense situations be it individual or in a group, because I don’t like to see others (or myself) struggle. Even when I fail, I see it as just a bump in the road and not a road block, even when I find myself slamming into a mile long concrete barricade. Also just knowing that every time you have to have those imaginary stitches in your forehead, life goes on and and I will heal while dominating.",

I've written and published two books while going to college full time so I would also say I have the ability to work on multiple projects at once and still give my full attention to each.
